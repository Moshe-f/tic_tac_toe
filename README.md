# TIC TAC TOE
A web application that allows you to play Tic Tac Toe.

## Gameplay
Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid.
Each player in turn marks a mark in one of the squares, the winning player is the one who managed to fill a row, column or diagonal with his marks. If no player has managed to do this until all the squares are full, the game ends in a draw.
